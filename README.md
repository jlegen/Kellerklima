# Kellerklima
## arduino based climate controller with indoor and outdoor sensors for fan control

I made this device to dry my (and others :) cellars by mostly making use of the times when the absolute humidity outdoors is lower than indoors. 
For this, two sensors are used to measure humidity and temperature, indoors and outdoors.
Though this seems to be quite a common design, i only found some rather costly commercial products. This one mostly uses cheap and popular modules.

Optionally, the data can also be sent to Thingspeak - making use of a tiny ESP8266 with ESPLink.
